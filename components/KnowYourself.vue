                Know your identity means: you and your team make clear the skills for known situations, and know your attributes in unknow situation.<br>
                If you know your individuality you can comunicate it better, and build trust about your identity to others.<br>
                Trust is more than just a feeling, it is a belief. an feeling is just a human emotion justified, a belief is a human emotion justified and rationalized.
