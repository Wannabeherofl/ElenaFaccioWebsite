            Hi! My name is Elena and I am a Marketing and strategy consultant. I am passionate about individuality and enjoy working on project with people.<br>
My passion about marketing and comunication started at very early age, I remember me at <span class="text-bold Third-font text-[#fdba74]">6</span> wondering about what is it and where are the roots for it. While studiend and researching about identity I started my volunteer carrer at <span class="text-bold Third-font text-[#fdba74]">12</span> and that made me understand that what i want to do in life is understand what people want need and help them to get it. that is why i chosed the University degree in Marketing Management.
After that I continued studing attending a class about tourism field focused on territory comunication and tourist welcoming.
In <span class="Third-font text-[#fdba74] text-bold">2023</span> I ejoyed the online class about Consumer Neuroscience & Neuromarketing.
